# 🚀 Automation_Journey

**Welcome to my Automation Journey!** 😊  
I’m excited to share my learning and progress as I dive into the world of automation testing! Let’s embark on this journey together. 🌟

## 🌟 **About the Project**
This repository is a collection of projects, code snippets, and notes as I start my exploration into the automation world. From basic scripts to advanced automation tools, I’ll be updating my progress here regularly!

## 🛠 **Tools & Technologies**
As I progress, I’ll be using and learning about several awesome tools and technologies:

- **Selenium** 🕸️ — For browser automation.
- **Java** ☕ — My primary programming language for writing automation scripts.
- **TestNG** ✅ — For test case management.
- **Maven** 🚀 — For project building and dependency management.
- **Git** 🌱 — For version control and collaboration.
- **Jenkins** ⚙️ — For continuous integration (CI) in automation.
